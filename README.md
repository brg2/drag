# drag
Drag elements around, style with css and change templates in real time with live collaboration and chat

A demo is available at [edit.meteor.com](http://edit.meteor.com/)

To open the editor, press Ctrl + E

Here is a list of possible commands:
- Ctrl + C: Clears all elements (Caution!)
- Ctrl + A: Adds a new element
- Ctrl + Shift + E: Toggles editor left or right
- Del: Deletes current element

To drag, simply click on an element and drag with your mouse to where you want the element to show. 

To resize, hold down the Shift key while dragging an element.

To "reparent" an element drag it over another and release. Now when you drag the parent, the children follow!

Click on the "element" header and it will switch to the "source" view where you can use the ShareJS live editor to collaborate on templating the element you selected. All the actions for dragging the elements around the screen will percolate to other users. Chat in the area at the bottom of the window and send messages by clicking the "send" button. If you have any questions or problems, add an issue for this project. Thanks!

Future stuff:
1. Improvement of chat system
2. Cleaner look and feel
3. Bug fixes
4. Optimizations
5. Speed and usability improvements
6. Code size reduction
7. etc
